# You can create variables

Variable is a temporary name for a value.

```javascript
let fruit = "apple";
```

You can change the value that the variable represents.

```javascript
let fruit = "apple";
fruit = "orange";
```

You can use the variable just as if it was a value on its own.

```javascript
let fruit = "apple";
let anotherFruit = fruit;
```

Even though they contain the same value now after changin one of them, the other stays untouched.

```javascript
let fruit = "apple";
let anotherFruit = fruit;
anotherFruit = "orange";
// fruit is still "apple"
// anotherFruit is "orange"
```
