# Variable points to many values over time

Every variable you have to declare first.

```javascript
let fruit;
```

To make variable represent a value, use assignment.

```javascript
fruit = "apple";
```

You can assign a value to a variable as you declare it.

```javascript
let fruit = "apple";
```

You can change the value that the variable represents anytime.

```javascript
let fruit = "apple";
fruit = "orange";
```

You can use the variable just as if it was a value on its own.
Here there are two variables created containing the same value.

```javascript
let fruit = "apple";
let anotherFruit = fruit;
```

Even though they contain the same value now after changin only one of them, the other does not change.

```javascript
let fruit = "apple";
let anotherFruit = fruit;
anotherFruit = "orange";
// fruit is still "apple"
// anotherFruit is "orange"
```
