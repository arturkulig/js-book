# Constant points to only one value

ℹ️ For simplicity sake both variables and constants are sometimes refered to as `variable`.

Every constant you have to declare first.
Unline variables, constants have to have a value right away.

```javascript
const fruit = "apple";
```

Don't try to reassign another value to a constant.

```javascript
fruit = "apple"; // ❌
```

You can use the constant just as if it was a value on its own.
Here there are two constants created containing the same value.

```javascript
const fruit = "apple";
const anotherFruit = fruit;
```
